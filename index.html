      <p>We take only the best salmon, grind them up whole, and stick them in our cookie batter.  But you wouldn't know that.  Our recipe is so amazing you wouldn't even guess that we throw the bones and organs into the batter.<br/>
      Not really. Could you imagine if we actually did that?<br/>
      We actually use only the best fillets from fresh salmon expertly prepared by our master chefs. We take our time and make sure no bones nor organs are included when we grind the fillets into our batter.</p>
